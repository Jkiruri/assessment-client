# Project Overview

In this assessment, I have successfully implemented a backend system using Laravel that includes the following features:

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Management
- **Show Users:** 
  - I have developed functionality to list all the users in the system.
  - Each user's information is displayed in a tabular format.

### 2. Album Management
- **Show Albums:**
  - I have implemented a feature to display all albums in the system.
  - Each album is listed with its respective details.
  
- **Show User's Albums:**
  - I can filter and display albums specific to a user.
  - This helps in managing and viewing albums owned by individual users.

### 3. Photo Management
- **Show Photos in an Album:**
  - For each album, I have provided functionality to view all photos contained within it.
  - Photos are displayed with their details including URL and a thumbnail image.

### 4. Authentication
- **User Authentication:**
  - I have implemented user authentication to secure the application.
  - Users must log in to access certain parts of the application.

- **Route Protection:**
  - Routes are protected using tokens to ensure that only authenticated users can access specific endpoints.
  - This prevents unauthorized access and enhances the security of the system.

## How to Use the System

1. **Log in to the system:**
   - Navigate to the login page.
   - Enter your credentials to authenticate.

2. **Navigate through the sections:**
   - Use the menu to navigate to Users, Albums, and Photos sections.
   - View the details by clicking on the respective links.

3. **Protected Routes:**
   - Certain routes are protected and require authentication.
   - Ensure you are logged in to access these routes.

## Conclusion

I have successfully developed a robust backend system with essential features for user, album, and photo management. The implementation of authentication and route protection enhances the security and usability of the application.
